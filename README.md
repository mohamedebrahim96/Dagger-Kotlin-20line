Dagger 2 for Dummies in Kotlin (with 20 lines of code)

I am a dummy, and learning Dagger 2 is stretching my brain!! All tutorials I read introduced so many things to me at once e.g. Dependency Injection, Provider, Component, Module, Scopeâ€¦ my brain just exploded!!

Besides many tutorials are based on Java. Kotlin is the way of doing things today. It takes me months to digest Dagger 2 and had it done in Kotlin. So I vow to myself when I grab hold of it, I should create something really super simple one day, make this like ABC, for those out there like me looking for something like this.

To make it more fancier, I can change the Simple Hello World App to Simple Hello Dagger 2 App. Code as below (bold those I add on top of the template).
```
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    val info = Info()

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        text_view.text = info.text

    }
}

class Info  {
    val text = "Hello Dagger 2"
}
```
